# La-Vida-Cafe
It's a restaurant website created using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
AIM:- Visually attractive restaurant website for viewing different categories of the restaurant and for ordering food.
For the project I used Xampp(for creating local host) and Sublime as text editor. 
Go to opening.html then register your details and then click on Login button. A login page will be displayed. Enter username and password. It will redirect you to the odering page from where you can order your food.
A screenshot of how the website would look is attached.
All the best!
